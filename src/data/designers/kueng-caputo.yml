  The young Swiss-born partnership Kueng Caputo have worked together since they
  were both students of design at the HGKZ Zurich from 2004 to 2008. Sarah Kueng
  and Lovis Caputo practice design as response with an emphasis on
  understatement and improvisation. Their first 'Five Stars Cardboard'
  installations at the Salone Satellite in 2007 went on to show in South Korea,
  Basel and New York.
