bio: >-
  Kwangho Lee lives and works in Seoul, South Korea, having received his BA in
  2007 from Hongik University, majoring in Metal Art & Design. Inspired by a
  childhood growing up on a farm with his grandparents, Lee uses humble
  materials and traditional techniques in innovative ways, whether his tables
  made from bundled rice straw or novel interpretations of weaving processes. He
  has developed a way of knitting industrial materials to create lamps from
  tangles of extension cords, as well as a series of couches and stools made
  from woven garden hoses, PVC, leather and silk, titled Obsession.
