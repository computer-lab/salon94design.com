bio: |
  Thomas Barger lives and works in Brooklyn, New York. He studied
  Architecture and Landscape Architecture at the University of Illinois, Urbana-
  Champaign. His work is a reaction to his experiences with modernist design
  and living in New York City. Composed of pigmented paper pulp constructed
  around wooden frames, the works take on unusual shapes reminiscent of
  childhood cartoons or papier-mâchéd fantasy balloon animals. He loves to
  drink green tea and his favorite animals are dogs and pygmy goats.
