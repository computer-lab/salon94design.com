bio: |-
  Born in 1993, the Houston native effortlessly floats between
  design, hip-hop, and fashion's various microcosms. At home in the post-Tumblr
  world of design, Kanu is driven by a predilection for subverting norms, an
  insatiable urge to create, and a love of melding street culture with design
  sensibilities.
