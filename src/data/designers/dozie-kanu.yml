bio: >-
  Dozie Kanu (b. 1993, Houston, TX) is an American artist and designer living
  and working in Lisbon, Portugal. Kanu studied Production Design for Film at
  The School of Visual Arts in New York. In 2016 he began working with design
  dealer, and co-founder of Salon 94 Design, Paul Johnson. In 2017 Kanu first
  exhibited with Salon 94 in the group show MIDTOWN at the Lever House in New
  York.


  Although Kanu has been labeled a designer, his practice is about adding layers
  of functionality to his work as an alternative to the dissociative
  subjectivity of sculpture. Kanu also aims to challenge public perceptions of
  design by bringing together concepts that reach far outside the realm of
  function, as that of an artist.


  In 2018 Kanu was invited to put a progressive outlook on RIMOWA’s timeless
  icon. The collaboration with RIMOWA unfolded through three separate but
  intertwined activations: a short film, an installation, and a printed
  publication in KALEIDOSCOPE issue 32. Kanu’s recent group exhibitions include
  "MIDTOWN", which took place at the historic Lever House, in Manhattan, and
  "Blow Up", curated by Felix Burrichter at Friedman Benda in Chelsea, New York.
  In 2018 Kanu was awarded the Hublot Design Prize, and exhibited his first solo
  show in London, "Humane Alternatives" at Soft Opening. In April 2019 Salon 94
  Design will present Kanu’s first solo show with Salon 94 Design.
