title: Gaetano Pesce
bio: >
  Gaetano Pesce was born in 1939 in La Spezia, Italy, and

  today lives and works in New York and Milan. His career spans five decades
  with international

  commissions and exhibitions in architecture, urban planning, interior, and
  industrial design. He is a

  founder of Radical Design (Italy, late 1960s). A guiding principle of his
  work, he has said,

  “modernism is less a style than a method for interpreting the present and
  hinting at the future in

  which individuality is preserved and celebrated.” Since the 1980s, Pesce has
  exploited the technical

  qualities of resins, polyurethanes and silicones to create signature pliable,
  corporeal, and organic

  design.
