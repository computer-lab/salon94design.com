bio: >-
  Challenging the conventions of both sculpture and jewelry making, Munich-based
  artist Karl Fritsch creates rings that read as miniature sculptures. Often
  intricately constructed yet coarsely finished, Fritsch’s rings are marked by
  rough, oxidized finishes and detectable fingerprints, conveying the urgency of
  the rings’ materialization. He playfully mixes high and low materials, giving
  equal billing to diamonds, rubies, plastic pearls and glass gemstones. By
  making all his sculptures wearable in the form of rings, Fritsch liberates his
  media from static presentation and creates an unprecedented intimacy to the
  works, simultaneously subverting the notion that jewelry is mere décor and
  that sculpture must be admired at a distance.
