bio: >-
  Lucas Samaras was already known as a sculptor, painter, and performance artist
  when he began experimenting with photography. In his early work, which
  includes multi-media assemblages, he often included images of himself. The
  persistent use of himself as a subject has led one critic to remark that
  "Samaras's almost obsessional self-observation extends past narcissism toward
  a physical understanding of himself."
