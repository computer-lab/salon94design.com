bio: >-
  Lucas Samaras has painted with gold and silver since the late 50s. The
  metallic found in the radiators around his studio and the metal paint tubes he
  was using at the time. More, gold imitates value. Known as his Wound
  paintings, they conjure trauma and pain. They are akin to contemporary icon
  paintings and Fontana’s slashes.


  The 22 karat gold jewelry is intentionally heavy, in the tradition of ancient
  ritualistic jewelry. Resisting gold’s long, serious "gold standard" history,
  Samaras chose a more playful, modest material from which to cast- chicken and
  hardware wire. A trademark, as are his rainbow yarn and tiny beads (Samaras
  has collected beaded necklaces for decades), Samaras has used the chicken wire
  for chairs and boxes since the 70s. The perfect material to manipulate and
  cut, the wire was also easily filled in with thick paint before casting. Each
  gold piece is unique, and there are approximately 60 pieces in his gold
  collection.
