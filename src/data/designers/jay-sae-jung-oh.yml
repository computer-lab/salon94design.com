bio: >-
  Jae Say Jung Oh describes her interests as lying at the intersection of art
  and design, particularly as reconciling the two ideas is an ongoing challenge
  for her. “I am always trying to combine them

  without losing the essence of each field,” she says. Oh was trained in
  sculpture and 3D design, and has worked with the artist Gaetano Pesce on
  projects including furniture installations and product design. Her best-known
  project, “Savage,” is comprised of a series of functional seating units and

  side tables. The earliest of these were made using mundane, mass-produced
  objects affixed together with epoxy and adhesive, after which the entire
  volumes wrapped with jute string. Each takes about four months to complete. In
  the newer iteration of “Savage,” Oh produces the objects in leather.
