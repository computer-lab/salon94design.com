  At Design Miami/ we are dedicating a booth to Philippe Malouin's monumental
  sculpture _Core_, that doubles as a bench.


  Malouinâ€™s _Core_ is a mammoth concrete modular system that assembles to become
  a forcible brutalist structure, functioning as a bench and as a stand-alone
  sculpture. Its rough-hewn concrete exterior is textured with pebbly aggregate
  and its curved interior hollows are ground down to a smooth, almost polished
  finish. _Core_ is Philippe's first architectural work. Malouin lives and works
  in London, where he operates his award-winning multidisciplinary interior
  design company, POST-OFFICE.
