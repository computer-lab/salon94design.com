description: >-
  Philippe Malouin’s _Core_ is a mammoth concrete modular system that assembles
  to become a forcible brutalist structure, functioning as a bench and as a
  stand-alone sculpture. Its rough-hewn concrete exterior is textured with
  pebbly aggregate and its curved interior hollows are ground down to a smooth,
  almost polished finish. Originally conceived as part of Superbenches, a
  project curated by Felix Burrichter and initiated by Andreas Angelidakis,
  _Core_ is Philippe Malouin’s first architectural work. Malouin lives and works
  in London, where he operates his award-winning multidisciplinary interior
  design company, POST- OFFICE.
