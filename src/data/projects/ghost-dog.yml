  Jeanne Greenberg Rohatyn and Paul Johnson are pleased to present the inaugural
  exhibition of Salon 94 Design. The show takes its spirit and name from the
  1999 Jim Jarmusch cult film,_Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai_. The
  protagonist of the film, the titular Ghost Dog, is a hitman who follows the
  ancient Samurai code. Like the Samurai, these designers work under the radar
  with their own self-prescribed sets of rules. The designers represent a wide
  geographic and generational sampling of design practices, yet each privileges
  the handmade, DIY mode of self-manufacturing.


  Thomas Barger lives and works in Brooklyn, New York. He studied Architecture
  and Landscape Architecture at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign.
  His work is a reaction to his experiences with modernist design and living in
  New York City. Composed of pigmented paper pulp constructed around wooden
  frames, the works take on unusual shapes reminiscent of childhood cartoons or
  papier-mâchéd fantasy balloon animals. He loves to drink green tea and his
  favorite animals are dogs and pygmy goats.


  Jack Craig lives and works in Detroit, Michigan. He was trained first as an
  engineer (Bachelor and Master of Science, University of Maryland, 2001 and
  2003). Later he worked for the US Navy in the infrared division before leaving
  to pursue an Industrial Design degree (Bachelor of Art, University of
  Illinois, 2010). He continued his studies at Cranbrook Academy of Art, earning
  a Master of Fine Art in 3D Design. His elegant works are composed of
  hand-dripped bronze and concrete.


  Kwangho Lee lives and works in Seoul, South Korea, having received his BA in
  2007 from Hongik University, majoring in Metal Art & Design. Inspired by a
  childhood growing up on a farm with his grandparents, Lee uses humble
  materials and traditional techniques in innovative ways, whether his tables
  made from bundled rice straw or novel interpretations of weaving processes. He
  has developed a way of knitting industrial materials to create lamps from
  tangles of extension cords, as well as a series of couches and stools made
  from woven garden hoses, PVC, leather and silk, titled Obsession.


  Jay Sae Jung Oh was born in South Korea, and lives and works in Seattle,
  Washington. She received her Masters Degree in Sculpture from Kookmin
  University, South Korea, and later joined the 3D Design Department at
  Cranbrook Academy of Art. She is a visiting professor teaching Industrial
  Design at the University of Illinois, Chicago. After Cranbrook, she
  apprenticed for eminent Italian designer, Gaetano Pesce. In her Savage Series,
  she first takes collected, discarded plastic objects and toys, then wraps them
  with individual cowhide leathercords. Oh hopes that upon viewing the pieces
  people will “reconsider the ordinary and find value in these products reborn.
  Innovation, invention, and beauty evident in even the most mundane, everyday
  objects that we take for granted and put to waste.”


  Gaetano Pesce, perhaps the godfather of this show, was born in 1939 in La
  Spezia, Italy, and today lives and works in New York and Milan. His career
  spans five decades with international commissions and exhibitions in
  architecture, urban planning, interior, and industrial design. He is a founder
  of Radical Design (Italy, late 1960s). A guiding principle of his work, he has
  said, “modernism is less a style than a method for interpreting the present
  and hinting at the future in which individuality is preserved and celebrated.”
  Since the 1980s, Pesce has exploited the technical qualities of resins,
  polyurethanes and silicones to create signature pliable, corporeal, and
  organic design. A new series of hanging lamps and wall sconces made from this
  material preside over a new cabinet, employing Pesce’s signature joyful voice
  and figuration in taking the shape of a clown.
