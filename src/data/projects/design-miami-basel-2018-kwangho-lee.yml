  Kwangho Lee’s _The Shape of a River_ series show the designer’s deep-rooted
  interest in his heritage and surroundings. Our Design Miami/Basel presentation
  juxtaposes exposed raw copper works with cherry wooden furniture inlayed with
  enameled copper.The series consists of chairs, vases, stools, lamps and
  consoles.


  The enameled copper tiles, framed in wood, are baked in a _chilbo_, a
  traditional Korean kiln that harnesses intense heat. _Chilbo_ translates
  roughly as “seven colors of gem.” In the process colored glass is applied wet
  or dry to copper sheets and fired in the furnace, sometimes repeatedly. The
  size of the _chilbo_ furnace allows Lee to open the door and check on the
  change of colors throughout the firing process. In these latest inlayed works,
  he has refined and perfected this ancient old technique.


  Lee’s raw copper works investigate the chemical and compositional interplay
  between heat and copper. Part of the design process is left to chance,
  creating glistening effects as the heat moves across the copper surface.
  Industrial sheets of copper are joined under tremendous heat.“The only thing I
  intended on was leaving the welded edges of the pieces as is,“ says the
  artist.“Normally, one sands them down for a smooth surface, but I kept the
  welded trail.“


  Kwangho Lee (born in Guri, Korea, 1981) completed his studies at Hongik
  University in Seoul, majoring Metal Art & Design, and graduated in February
  2007.He currently lives and works in Seoul.Making things by hand was a great
  joy as a child, reminding his grandfather who, a farmer himself, constantly
  hand-made daily household goods from natural materials found nearby. Kwangho
  Lee appreciated the way he looked at everyday objects and thus began to
  approach things in similar ways; to give new meaning and function to the most
  ordinary.Today, he develops his practice by discovering moments of materials
  joining another.He has made works with marble, copper and enamel, steel, and
  rope; Lee often describes his works as an instant moment of union.


  Lee’s works are in the collection of the Museum of Applied Arts and Sciences,
  Sydney, Australia; Leeum, Seoul, Korea; M + Museum, Hong Kong, China; Daegu
  Art Museum, Daegu, Korea; San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, San Francisco,
  USA; and the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts, Montreal, Canada.He was nominated
  for the Jury’s Selection of Designer of the Future at Design Miami/Basel in
  2009, selected as Artist of the Year in 2011 by the Korean Ministry of
  Culture, and Young Craftsman of the Year in 2013 by Yeol - a society for
  cultural heritage. In 2017 he won Made’s designer of the year.He has recently
  completed the large scale commission of the Amorepacific headquarters built by
  David Chipperfield Architects in Seoul, Korea.
