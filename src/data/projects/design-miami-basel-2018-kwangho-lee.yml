  Kwangho Lee’s The Shape of a River Series investigates the chemical and
  compositional interplay between heat and copper. He leaves part of the design
  process up to chance, creating a glaring effect on the copper by flickering
  heat on its surface. He explores and exposes simple forms through the
  material’s elements, joined industrial sheets of copper under tremendous heat.
  “The only thing I intended on was leaving the welded edges of the pieces as
  is,“ says the artist. “Usually you sand them down so the surface comes out
  very smooth, but I kept the welded trail.“ 


  Kwangho Lee grew up in a small city next to Seoul, Korea. He completed his
  studies at Hongik University in Seoul, majoring Metal Art & Design, and
  graduated in February 2007. He currently lives and works in Seoul. This year
  marks his 10th year since the start of his career as a designer. Making things
  by hand was a great joy as a child, reminding his grandfather who, a farmer
  himself, constantly hand-made daily household goods from natural materials
  found nearby. Kwangho Lee appreciated the way he looked at everyday objects
  and thus began to approach things in similar ways; to give new meaning and
  function to the most ordinary. Today, as he continuously presents new series
  of works, he develops his practice by discovering moments of materials joining
  another. Until now he made works on marble, copper and enamel, steel and steel
  and tries to describe in his works the instant moment of union. 


  Lee’s works are in the collection of the Museum of Applied Arts and Sciences,
  Sydney; Leeum, Seoul; M + Museum, Hong Kong; Daegu art museum, Daegu; San
  Francisco Museum of Modern Art, San Francisco; and the Montreal Museum of Fine
  Arts, Montreal
