  “My furniture is turning into sculpture. Since ‘coming out’ to my family last
  winter I have been reflecting more than ever about my childhood experiences.
  Each piece seems to be split down the middle with an equal focus on a love
  element and a utilitarian one. This body of work embraces my past as I enter
  into adulthood.”


  —_Thomas Barger_, 2017



  Thomas Barger grew up on his family homestead in Illinois, where his childhood
  was filled with farming, a rigorous religious practice, and community.
  Shifting his landscape at 22, Barger moved to New York, where he interned at
  MoMA PS 1, while exploring the city streets and making money as a dog walker.
  For his inaugural show at Salon 94 Design, Barger converges both personal
  histories - his rural roots and his urban route - to tell his story, and
  define his material form.


  Specific shared memories with loved ones are translated into usable
  sculptures; several of the pieces, for example, embrace the daily repetitive
  housework of Barger’s mother. In his hands, her tasks are re-ordered to high
  ritual. Recalling the washing and folding of laundry, his sorters and hampers
  recount his mother’s care. Further, each basket is dedicated to a friend or
  family member, where there is a transference of his mother’s task into his own
  hand: “a basket for Sarah, a basket for David, a basket for Dad, a basket for
  Mom, a basket for me.” _Learning to Fold Laundry_ is inspired by material
  found on the farm, such as alfalfa hay and sisal baling twine. This sculpture
  combines a rug and organizing containers using a coil-like technique.


  Sunday dinners are celebrated, and as the family grows, tables are added over
  time. Barger describes his foldable picnic table _My Family is Getting Bigger_
  as a sculpture with roots in family gatherings.“My family would come together
  after church, when either my aunt, grandma, or mom would be the hostess, and
  cook an insane amount of food for our family. Now that my brother and sister
  are getting married, their spouses become part of the family too and in doing
  so expanding the family, highlighting one of my fondest memories with my
  family-family dinners.” A concrete and aggregate bench includes rock from the
  artist’s childhood creek beyond the cattle pasture. Recalling sandcastles made
  by this riverbed, Barger continues to pick up rocks on the Rockaways. Their
  shapes and contours inspire the detailing of the curves in his work.


  While on his dog walking route, Barger noticed massive recycling bags filled
  with paper documents outside a West Village police station on Charles Street,
  and began dragging them home and shredding the paper into pulp using a
  Cuisinart. The pulp was then molded into chairs, dried, sealed with resin, and
  finally painted.The paper pulp of the _Charles_ chairs, for example are
  sourced from these recycled paper documents. Frames might be recycled from a
  recognizable chair or one of his own making. Other works are carved out of
  large foam pieces found in "free stuff" on Craigslist.


  Barger studied both Landscape Architecture and Architecture at University of
  Illinois, Urbana-Champaign and then apprenticed with artist/designers - such
  as Misha Kahn and Jessi Reaves. “Because I was not trained as a skilled
  builder, I would build on top of the chair frames and create my own chair
  while not being responsible for the structure. Today, I often make my own
  frames to create exactly what I want. I think this is an interesting part of
  the process where I reflect on how an artist approaches making a chair
  compared to a designer. I believe a designer tries to develop efficient means
  to make/reproduce a chair where function trumps form. But I identify as an
  artist making furniture. And my responsibility and interest in furniture isn’t
  primarily in function.” The curved forms appeared in his work when he left
  working in architecture and began to embrace a hands-on craft movement
  approach.


  Barger has emerged as a unique colorist. His pinks are strangely close to skin
  tone, his yellows unlit day glow, his greens the kind that seem unreal when
  found in nature. His changing proportions, rounded edges, together with his
  tones make up an ever evolving environment of its own, growing out of a strict
  formative style towards a more free-spirited approach.


  Thomas Barger was born in Mattoon, Illinois in 1992. He lives and works in
  Brooklyn, New York. He studied Architecture and Landscape Architecture at the
  University of Illinois, Urbana - Champaign, Illinois. In 2017 Barger’s work
  has been included in the following group shows _MIDTOWN_, at Lever House;
  _Ghost Dog_ at Salon 94 Design, and _Distortion/Proportion_ at Wintercheck
  Factory in Brooklyn.


  Thomas Barger _Growing Up_ will be on view at 1 Freeman Alley, New York, NY
  10002 from March 6 - March 31, 2018 with an opening reception on March 6 from
  6-8 pm. The exhibition will be open to public from Wednesday to Saturday 10 am
  - 6 pm.
