  _Sedia Portaritratti_ is a monumental installation conceived by Gaetano Pesce.
  The title of the work is a play on the Italian words for “drawing,”
  “portrait,” and “frame.” The four-meter-tall standing chair, covered in human
  caricature portraits, displays a variety in figuration—more than twenty
  distinct faces—that stands for the diversity and uniqueness of human nature.


  The enormous chair is an homage to both the collective and the individual. In
  an era in which everything adheres to a specific standard and there are so
  many global constants, uniqueness and individuality are what draws the future
  closer and what transforms the present into progress.
