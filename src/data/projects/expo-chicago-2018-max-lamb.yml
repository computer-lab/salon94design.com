  **Max Lamb**


  Expo Chicago 2018


  September 27th - 30th


  Max Lamb designs sophisticated and personal bodies of work particular to
  material, location, and tradition. His series unfold intimate stories from
  conceptions, creation, and to completion. He has carved stone from China to
  Italy, and Vermont, and cast bronze from polystyrene molds. Each chair, bench,
  table and vase is unique, and many can live outdoors.


  Max Lamb’s Thermal Spray Series, exclusive to Salon 94 Design, demonstrate his
  hands-on approach. His motto, “Let’s just make it instead of drawing it,” is
  visible in these hand cut polystyrene forms that are sprayed with a bronze,
  copper or aluminum coating. After the first one, featured at the 11th
  International Festival of Design at the Villa Noailles, Hyères, France, a
  series was commissioned for Acne Studios’s flagship stores in New York and San
  Francisco. The Thermal Spray Series can be commissioned, and includes all
  sorts of objects: planters, vases, shelving units, tables, and chairs.


  In 2018 the Art Institute of Chicago selected Max Lamb as their designer for
  the inaugural exhibition, Max Lamb: Exercises in Seating, of the Franke/Herro
  Design Series, where curator Zoe Ryan highlights the work of important
  emerging talent. In 2016, Max’s work was included in the Design Triennial
  Beauty at the Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum in New York. His work
  has been widely exhibited at galleries and institutions both in Europe and the
  US, including Salon 94 Design.


  His presentations have been featured in numerous design magazines. He designed
  the interior of the Acne flagship store on Madison Avenue in New York and on
  Geary Street in San Francisco. Max Lamb was born in St. Austell, Cornwall,
  England, in 1980. He lives and works in London, United Kingdom.
