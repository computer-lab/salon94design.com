  During our Design Miami presentation we invite the audience backstage - the
  space where we work, study designer prototypes, experiment, and seat
  ourselves. We will stage this inside "warehouse" view, where the floor will
  feature historical and new works by Gaetano Pesce, Dozie Kanu, Max Lamb,
  Philippe Malouin, Kwangho Lee, Thomas Barger, and Tom Sachs.


  Alongside Alex Sizemore and Paul Johnson present a large inspiration wall,
  entitled _4th Qtr 2018_. Please join the pair on Wednesday and Thursday
  between 1 - 2 pm as they walk us through their mood board.
