  Max Lamb’s new _Aluminum Thermal Spray Series_, exclusive to Salon 94 Design,
  are presented in London for the first time. His motto, “Let’s just make it
  instead of drawing it,” is visible in these hand cut polystyrene forms that
  are sprayed with a bronze, copper or aluminum coating. After the first Thermal
  Spray Chair, featured at the 11th International Festival of Design at the
  Villa Noailles, Hyères, France, a series was commissioned for Acne Studios’s
  flagship stores in New York and San Francisco. The Thermal Spray Series can be
  commissioned in copper, bronze and aluminum, in various sorts of objects:
  planters, vases, shelving units, tables, and chairs. 


  In 2018 the Art Institute of Chicago selected Max Lamb as their designer for
  the inaugural exhibition, Max Lamb: Exercises in Seating, of the Franke/Herro
  Design Series, where curator Zoe Ryan highlights the work of important
  emerging talent. In 2016, Max’s work was included in the Design Triennial
  Beauty at the Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum in New York. His work
  has been widely exhibited at galleries and institutions both in Europe and the
  US, including Salon 94 Design. His presentations have been featured in
  numerous design magazines. He designed the interior of the Acne flagship store
  on Madison Avenue in New York and on Geary Street in San Francisco. Max Lamb
  was born in St. Austell, Cornwall, England, in 1980. He lives and works in
  London, United Kingdom.
