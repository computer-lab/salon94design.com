description: "At Frieze’s inaugural art fair in Los Angeles, Salon 94 Design is presenting new works by Max Lamb and Thomas Barger, as well as Gaetano Pesce’s _Pratt Chair No. 7 1984/2018._\n\nMax Lamb’s unmistakable furniture combines materials in their raw form, with the latest technologies. For Frieze Los Angeles, Lamb presents new _Scrap Poly_ works that are coated in his signature high-density polyurethane rubber coating, this time in powder pink! Lamb’s _Scrap Poly_ is an ongoing body of work that utilizes scraps of polystyrene, generated during the production of his other Poly Furniture works, to make furniture that is traditional in function but wholly unique in form. Iterations of the _Scrap Poly_ series can be seen in Acne’s retail stores including their flagship on Madison Avenue in New York, Geary Street in San Francisco, and Beijing, China\n\nThomas Barger has emerged as a unique colorist. His pinks are strangely fleshy, his yellows an unlit day glow, his greens the kind that seem unreal when found in nature, and now he is adding navy blue to his roster. A new series of works, _Table for Helms Deep_ is a manifestation of Barger’s return to reading _Lord of the Rings_, the fantasy novel written by J. R. R. Tolkien. A major battle episode in the novel which takes place at Helms Deep after nightfall, prompts the title of these works and its color. The navy blue of _Table for Helms Deep_ is also a frighteningly accurate color of our current times. Barger’s new works are the result of a fantastically bizarre coming together of J. R. R. Tolkien’s high fantasy writings, and Barger’s artistic principals. \n\nIn 1984 Gaetano Pesce requested to use Pratt’s laboratory, studio space, and tools to make the molds for a special chair he had sculpted in wax. Thus the _Pratt Chair_ was named. Initially, Pesce intended to make a series of 81 chairs using nine different resin formulas, yielding nine chairs from each formula, however in this initial experiment he made only thirty-four. \rSince 1984, new technologies and resin pigments pressed Pesce to rethink the thirty-four year old _Pratt Chair_. Thus the original mold was taken down from its workshop shelf, dusted and mended. In several steps, Pesce’s studio painstakingly made a new chair with the original cracked mold, and then made a new mold from this chair. Each new Pratt Chair is made by meticulously hand painting each detail on the mold, before it is filled with pigmented resin. Pesce’s material processes has always been experiments in liquid form — the liquidity of resin is a metaphor for the character of our time, “where values move around, up and down like a liquid”, says Pesce. At Frieze Los Angeles, Salon 94 Design will present _Pratt Chair No. 7 1984/2018_, the revival of Gaetano Pesce’s _Pratt Chair_ from 1984."
