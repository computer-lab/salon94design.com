  _The farther you go into your past, meaning as close as possible to your
  birth, the more impossible it is to remember anything. However, I remember as
  a 4 year old sitting on the ground with just a cloth to sit on, when my father
  came towards me, threw me a gold coin, and then left. Later, I found out that
  he went to America. My mother and I did not see him for 9 years. And the
  curious thing is that I remember him tossing this thick heavy yellow coin- it
  must have been gold. After that, I don’t remember picking it up, or showing it
  to my mother or grandmother, I just remember the throw, my father gone, and
  that was it._


  —Lucas Samaras, September 25, 2017


  Salon 94 Design is pleased to present _Lucas Samaras: Gold_, an exhibition of
  the pioneering Greek-American artist’s explorations in gold through sculpture,
  painting, and jewelry. The exhibition highlights three distinct bodies of
  work: a series of gold-plated bronze sculptures from 1980-81, 22 karat gold
  jewelry cast from chicken wire made between 1996-98, and his
  gold_Wound_paintings made between 1999-2000.


  Samaras has painted with gold and silver since the late 50s. The metallic
  found in the radiators around his studio and the metal paint tubes he was
  using at the time. More, gold imitates value. Known as his Wound paintings,
  they conjure trauma and pain. They are akin to contemporary icon paintings and
  Fontana’s slashes.


  Samaras’ tabletop bronze sculptures depict transformed mythological figures,
  twisting and turning. There are winged and back-bending figures with old and
  young faces. Modern furies modeled in clay, and then cast in bronze and gold
  plated.


  The 22 karat gold jewelry is intentionally heavy, in the tradition of ancient
  ritualistic jewelry. Resisting gold’s long, serious "gold standard" history,
  Samaras chose a more playful, modest material from which to cast- chicken and
  hardware wire. A trademark, as are his rainbow yarn and tiny beads (Samaras
  has collected beaded necklaces for decades), Samaras has used the chicken wire
  for chairs and boxes since the 70s. The perfect material to manipulate and
  cut, the wire was also easily filled in with thick paint before casting. Each
  gold piece is unique, and there are approximately 60 pieces in his gold
  collection.


  The exhibition also features one of Samaras’ unique gold-plated bronze chairs
  from 1983, and an iconic exploded_Stick Chair _from 1989. For more
