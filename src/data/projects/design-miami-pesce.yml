  Cabinets in a playful range of subjects, from embracing lovers to horses and
  trees, have been a staple of Pesce’s oeuvre since the 1970s. One of our
  featured cabinets, his 2007 Do You Still Love Me? Cabinet, when closed,
  depicts two lovers facing away from each other, quarrelling, one sticking out
  its tongue. When open, the faces come together in a reconciliatory kiss.


  In this presentation, we celebrate Pesce as a master of material. His cabinets
  are constructed of wood, metal, polyurethane resin, and papier maché. These
  different materials create unique effects in each cabinet. The foliage of the
  tree-shaped Puglia Cabientis made using papier maché. With elegance and
  humor, Pesce modernizes the Japanese gold leaf and red lacquer cabinetry in
  his 2006 Horse Cabinet.
