  Maccarone, Salon 94 Design, and Salon 94 are pleased to announce their
  exhibition MIDTOWN, which will take place from May 3-June 9, 2017, at the
  historic Lever House, in Midtown Manhattan. The exhibition encompasses the
  building’s second floor office space, with its glass windows offering views
  inside and out. Defying the hierarchies between art and design, this show
  features sculpture, furniture, vessels, baskets, tapestries, and paintings, by
  more than 40 artists. Together these works co-mingle in the openness and
  emptiness of the space. MIDTOWN celebrates the dialogue and collaborative
  spirit of art-making practices, and posits collegial collaboration, as artists
  and galleries have enthusiastically allowed for the reimagining of the context
  of their works.


  Art, design, and commerce are longtime bedfellows. In the heyday of New York
  Modernism, the commercial industries of real estate, department stores, and
  furniture manufacturers colluded with fine art and its highest institutions.
  Curators from the Metropolitan Museum of Art lectured on the attributes of
  Modernism in the progressive showrooms of Lord & Taylor and Macy's department
  stores. The lines separating art and industry, high and low, fine art, craft,
  and design blurred. This dialogue took place and was bought and sold in
  midtown Manhattan. Yet, there has been an uneven relationship between these
  disciplines. Art has traditionally trumped functionality. A tapestry placed on
  the floor is drained of value. Attempting to upset this distinction, MIDTOWN
  regards objects equally, irrespective of their functionality or method of
  creation.


  Together, the works on view provoke further questions about value. If an
  object does not look slick, fabricated, and over-produced, does it have more
  integrity? If a work is handmade, is it more or less valuable? The fine lines
  between art and craft, artist and artisan, fade. This show demonstrates an
  interest in exploiting this collision. Artists such as Rosy Keyser, Leonor
  Antunes, and Josep Grau-Garriga create contemplative yet confrontational
  scenarios using paint, rope, and fabric. Jessi Reaves’ deconstructed and
  recomposed fan, Urs Fischer’s cast foam recliner, and Gaetano Pesce’s poured
  resin floor seduce. Vito Acconci, Max Lamb, and Nate Lowman tell stories, and
  their works are made by the span of their own bodies. They distort,
  radicalize, and improve upon the familiar and functional. Luis Flores, Sarah
  Lucas, Carly Mark, and Ruby Neri use sculptural surrogates to extend their
  absurd fantasies based on a collective cultural consciousness. Kenzi Shiokava,
  Kwangho Lee, and Oscar Tuazon carry a deep reverence for nature, and their
  works elegantly reinforce the precarious relationship between the organic and
  synthetic. Anton Alvarez, Dozie Kanu, and Andrea Zittel’s works examine ways
  to make new domestic propositions.


  In the 90s after the dot-com boom abruptly deflated, giant office spaces felt
  like cities leveled by tornadoes. Wires hung from ceilings, empty electrical
  outlets beckoned hungrily, and desk chairs sat empty. No phones rang. Copiers
  weren’t copying. Emails weren’t being sent. After a period of extreme
  technological development and economic growth at an absurd speed, the high was
  over. This vacant office space, situated within an iconic Modernist building,
  evokes that post dot-com era—empty and mute. However, an uncanny energy and
  implied power emanates from this space with no walls and bare electricity.


  Above, firms buzz with energy, money is being made, and blue chip art hangs on
  the walls. How, in this building, does one negotiate a commercial gallery
  exhibition about a return to the handmade, with feelings of anxiety, unease,
  instability, tenderness, rawness, and the restlessness of our time? The show
  does not necessarily answer that question, but it offers a space for
  contemplation, interrogation, and consideration of this conundrum and reminds
  us of the interdependence between art and life.


  Galleries can react quickly—with a speed unmatched by institutional
  colleagues. The idea for this show was inspired only a few months ago by a
  conversation about art, design, and real estate. Thus the show is additive,
  formal, and intuitive. Traversing the space, from a beaded Nick Cave
  _Soundsuit_, to a silk and bronze Barbara Chase-Riboud abstracted homage
  portrait, to Alex Hubbard’s crumpled resin painting of cast garbage, and
  finally to Hannah Levy’s unusable latex lounge chair, with little shocks and
  pokes, this exhibition is an attempt to bring together stimulating objects
  made by artists on the frontline of our creative culture.
