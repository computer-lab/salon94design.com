  “_Boulders_ is a deeply personal pilgrimage to the mountain landscape
  surrounding the Italian village of Carisolo, an exploration of the waterfalls
  and river ways of Adamello. On the five or so previous trips to visit Pedretti
  Graniti, I had hiked some of the mountain trails on route to the quarry, and
  collected from the rivers a handful of the smooth rounded pebbles of the same
  black and white speckled granite found in the quarry. The power of the fast
  paced river can be heard, felt and even tasted in the air due to the fine
  spray drifting down the valley from the thundering Cascate di Nardis
  waterfall. The power of the river is also immediately visible in the way it
  has carved the landscape over millions of years, and perhaps only slightly
  quicker, shaped the riverbed and eroded the loose granite rocks as they tumble
  down stream until they become perfectly smooth rounded boulders.”


  — Max Lamb, October 31, 2017


  Max Lamb designs sophisticated and personal bodies of work particular to
  material, location, and tradition. His series unfold intimate stories from
  conception, creation, and to completion. He has carved stone from China to
  Italy, and Vermont, and cast bronze from polystyrene molds.


  For his first solo exhibition with Salon 94 Design, Lamb presents _Boulders_,
  a new series consisting of eleven chairs and nine stools telling the story of
  the Adamello mountain range, their geology, and the force of the river that
  continues to sculpt the Tonalite granite into smooth boulders in perpetuity.


  With _Boulders_, Lamb playfully riffs on ancient rings and standing stones
  found in his native England. Still more than a 1000 examples exist from the
  Bronze Age such as Avebury, Ring Brodgar, and StoneHenge. During his
  upbringing, Lamb was fascinated with a neolithic stone circle close to his
  home in Cornwall the _Merry Maiden_s or _Dawn’s Men_, similar to the Cornish_
  Dans Maen_ which translates as “Stone Dance.”


  After millions of years, nature gradually and imperceptibly moulds the
  landscape and moves the Tonalite rocks down the river. In a single action Lamb
  lifts the boulders from the riverbed and slices them into furniture. One clean
  cut exposes the heart of each Tonalite boulder. Lamb's elegant, modern and
  anthropomorphic intervention makes each work unique. Alongside _Boulders_ is a
  film of their making: following their path down the waterfall and river to
  their selection, extraction, cutting, grinding, and polishing. Lamb’s
  obsession with the mechanics of moving stone is evident.


  Max Lamb was born in St. Austell, Cornwall, England, in 1980. He lives and
  works in London, United Kingdom. He is presently on a residency at The Wornick
  Distinguished Visiting Professor of Wood Arts within the Furniture Program of
  California College of the Arts in San Francisco. His work has been widely
  exhibited at galleries and institutions both in Europe and the US. His work
  was included in the Design Triennial _Beauty_ at the Cooper Hewitt,
  Smithsonian Design Museum in New York in 2016. In 2017, Salon 94 Design
  featured his thermal spray work at Design Miami/Basel. His work was also
  prominently present inMidtown, a group show at Lever House in New York. In
  2018, he will have a solo show, _Exercises in Seating_ at the Art Institute of
  Chicago. His presentations have been featured in numerous design magazines. He
  currently designed the interior of the Acne flagship store on Madison Avenue
  in New York and on Geary Street in San Francisco.
