  Salon 94 Design was established in 2017 by Jeanne Greenberg Rohatyn and Paul
  Johnson. Since 2002 Salon 94 has hosted exhibitions of innovative art and
  design. After opening two more traditional galleries on the Lower East Side —
  Salon 94 Bowery and Salon 94 Freemans — Greenberg Rohatyn continued adding
  designers like Rick Owens and Martin Szekely. Now, Greenberg Rohatyn has
  partnered with Paul Johnson of Johnson Trading Gallery to found Salon 94
  Design. With an inaugural show named "Ghost Dog" _after Jim Jarmusch’s 1999
  cult samurai film, Salon 94 Design combined pieces by Gaetano Pesce and
  Seoul-based Kwangho Lee, as well as newer talents like Jack Craig who
  contributed lamps of marble blocks covered with hand-dripped bronze. "MIDTOWN"
  the second exhibition of Salon 94 Design, in collaboration with Maccarone,
  took place this June at the historic Lever House in Midtown Manhattan. The
  exhibition encompassed the building’s second floor office space, with its
  glass windows offering views inside and out. Defying the hierarchies between
  art and design, the show featured sculpture, furniture, vessels, baskets,
  tapestries, and paintings by more than 40 artists and designers. Together
  these works celebrated the dialogue and collaborative spirit of art-making
  practices, mixing vintage and contemporary with works by Isamu Noguchi, Jay
  Sae Jung Oh, Thomas Barger, Kueng Caputo, Dozie Kanu and Betty Woodman.
  _MIDTOWN_also featured a small retrospective of Max Lamb’s process based works
  from the past decade. With a growing roster of emerging and renowned
  designers, Salon 94 Design produces exhibitions that challenge the traditions
  and boundaries between fine art, functional objects, and the decorative arts.


  Salon 94 Design represents Anton Alvarez, Thomas Barger, Kueng Caputo, Jack
  Craig, Karl Fritsch, Jay Sae Jung Oh, Dozie Kanu, Max Lamb, Kwangho Lee, Rick
  Owens, and Gaetano Pesce among others.
