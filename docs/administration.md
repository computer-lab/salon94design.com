# Salon 94 Design Administration

salon94design.com uses [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) for hosting the site
and [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/) for editing site content. Site
data and user accounts are managed on [GitHub](https://www.github.com).

## Creating a GitHub account

You will need a GitHub account to:

* Log in to the CMS
* Add additional CMS users

To create a GitHub account:

1. Navigate to [github.com](https://github.com/).
2. Complete the signup form on the home page.
3. Verify the email you used to sign up.
4. Login to GitHub at [github.com](https://github.com/login).

## Joining the GitHub repository

In order to log in to the CMS, you must be a collaborator on the
[Salon 94 GitHub repository](https://github.com/computer-lab/salon94design.com).
An existing collaborator must invite you to the GitHub repository using the
procedure in the following section.

## Adding a user to the GitHub repository

To add a new collaborator:

1. Log on to GitHub as a user with access to the GitHub repository - currently,
   Ryan has this capability with his **ryansalon94design** account.
2. Navigate to the [collaboration page](https://github.com/computer-lab/salon94design.com/settings/collaboration).
3. Scroll down to the **Collaborators** section.
4. Search for the username, full name or email address of the collaborator you
   want to add. Note that they must have first created a GitHub account as
   described above.
5. GitHub will send a confirmation email. Once the user confirms their intention
   to collaborate by clicking the confirmation link they will be able to edit
   content in the CMS.
6. In the permission level dropdown select:
    * **Admin** if you want the user to be able to add additional collaborators
      and edit the CMS.
    * **Write** if you want the user to be able to edit the CMS but **not** add
      additional collaborators.

## Logging in to the CMS

Netlify CMS runs in your browser, so it is not necessary to log on to another
site to use it. You can access the CMS on the salon94design.com site by
navigating to the [admin page](https://salon94design.com/admin/).

The page will prompt you to click a button that says `Log in with GitHub`. By
clicking this button, a window will pop-up where you can log in to GitHub and
confirm that the CMS can use your account to access site data.

Once you have successfully logged in, you will be redirected to the CMS.
